{"name":"kev","tagline":"Viewer for MSDN's KeysExport.xml file","body":"KeysExport Viewer 0.0.2.0\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\nKeysExport Viewer, or KEV for short because I'm lazy, is a viewer for the\r\nKeysExport.xml file available to MSDN subscribers. This file contains all of\r\nthe serial numbers that they have generated or that have been generated for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt's very easy to download new versions of this file, but I'd rather not have\r\nto read through a bunch of XML if I'm trying to grab the right key to use on\r\nan install. Yes, I'm lazy. If it makes the situation any better, writing this\r\nlittle application also let me learn a few new things about C# and .NET that I\r\nhadn't had a chance to play with yet.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n* Displays each serial number for product keys\r\n* Displays HTML data where present in place of serial numbers\r\n\r\nFuture Goals\r\n------------\r\nThe one disadvantage KEV has to my previous system of a text file where I\r\nenter the keys I've used is that I can't make any notes in the document (and\r\nif I do, they'll be overwritten when I update the file). My one and only goal\r\nat the moment is to support adding comments, which will be saved to a separate\r\nfile to ensure they still exist if a new XML file is downloaded.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nThis program is licensed under the [MIT license][license].\r\n\r\n[license]: https://github.com/rnelson/KeysExportViewer/blob/master/LICENSE","google":"UA-42672537-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
